Hello! My name is John Sokol. I'm a Data Scientist at FMC Corporation in Philadelphia and an Adjunct Faculty Member at Stockton University in Galloway, New Jersey.

## Background
I graduated Stockton University with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry, and a computer science minor in May 2017. Exposure to computer science as an undergraduate shifted my interests from the natural sciences to software engineering and data science. I was accepted into the Master of Science in [Data Science & Strategic Analytics](http://stockton.edu/datascience) program at my undergraduate alma mater, and graduated in August 2018.

## Professional Experience
I was hired as a Data Scientist at NewLane Finance, an equipment finance company, in April 2019 to build processes and workflows for lead generation, predictive analytics applied to lead scoring, and business intelligence and analytics.

As an adjunct, the following are my course offerings:
* GNM 2256 - Designing Graphs Seeing Numbers: Undergraduate business analytics course for students of all majors to learn data storytelling by means of building coherent, interactive visualizations.
* GNM 2114 - Statistics and Sports: Applied Baseball statistics course to learn fundamental statistics concepts, such as summary statistics, distributions, plotting, comparative analysis, and regression lines.
* DSSA 5201 - Machine Learning Fundamentals: Graduate level quantitative intensive course with a focus on ML algorithm implementation, application of these algorithms applied to a business use case, and building a data science career.

In my spare time, I enjoy spending time with family, photography, unique food experiences, running, tennis, biking, and lifting.
